title: Steps to order food online
----

1. **Open Food Delivery App**: Open the food delivery app in your mobile. Swiggy and Zomato are two examples of online food delivery services.

2.	**Add/Change Location**: If you're ordering food to be delivered to your home, simply switch on your location on your phone, and the app will detect your present location and deliver to it. If you're ordering food to be delivered to a different place, you can manually enter the address and the app will display food options for delivery to that region. 

3.	**Search for Restaurant**: Search for the restaurant where you prefer to order or choose from the list of recommended restaurants. You can apply filters based on your preferences and browse through the categories and restaurants that appear.

4.	**Add to Cart**: Once you've landed to your preferred restaurant's page, you may begin adding food to your cart. You can also select add-ons (for example, extra cheese, amount, and so on) and add them to your cart. You can add the restaurant to your wish list for future convenience.

5.	**Check out**: The next step is to check out and pay for the products you've placed to your cart from the restaurant. You can pay by credit card, e-wallet, or online transfer, or through COD (Cash on Delivery). After you've made your choice, you can go ahead and pay.

6.	**Tracking**: After your order has been placed successfully, all you have to do now is wait for it to be delivered. Throughout this procedure, you can obtain real-time information on where your order is in the delivery process. You may also track the order and the delivery person on the map once it's out for delivery.

7.	**Post Delivery**: You can leave a rating and review for the food or restaurant you ordered from after it has been delivered successfully. You can also view your order details in the history section.
